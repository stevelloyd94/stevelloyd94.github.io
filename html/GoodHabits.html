                <p>Taking care of my health is very important for me as I want to live longer, have a healthier life, with a higher quality of life in my later years.
                    and to prevent diseases that can have negative consequences on my physical and mental well-being. Here are some foods I eat on a regular basis: <br></br>
                    
                    Walnuts, pecan nuts, pistachio nuts, eggs, olive oil, extra virgin olive oil, ghee, pomegranates, berries, red meat and raw honey<br></br>

                    Other things I do for my health is: at least 45 mins of exercise daily, +7.5 hours of sleep daily, getting sunlight for vitaminD
