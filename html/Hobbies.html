                <h1 class="headings"> Content Creation</h1>
                <p> In my free time, I create content on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram - I take interesting stories, fun-facts, jokes etc. and interesting QnA's that 
                    bring curiosity to the viewer and create it in the form of a video where people that come across my content watch! <br></br>
                
                    TikTok is the most successful social media platform for me as of right now - As of April 19, 2023, I have a total of 57.2k followers and more than 13 
                million likes</p>

                <h1 class="headings"> Gaming</h1>
                <p>Gaming has been a hobby for me since 2008 when my dad gifted me a Nintendo Wii with Mario Kart Wii and later New Super Mario Bros Wii.
                    I mostly play Agar.io, a game that I started playing since 2015.<br></br>

                     I have played lots of Minecraft when I was 9 & 10 years old and even played with
                    my brothers a lot during the Covid19 Lockdown. I have also played Clash of Clans with my friends growing up in 2015/2016. Other games
                    I have played are Stardew Valley, Boom Beach & Hay Day <br></br>

                    However, I have the most memories with the games Minecraft & Agar.io - my favorite youtubers being - DanTDM, JFM for Minecraft &
                     Smash, Jumbo and Crystal for Agar.io
