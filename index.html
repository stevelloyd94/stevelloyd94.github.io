                <h2> STEVE LLOYD</h2>
                <p> Hi! My name is Steve Lloyd and I am 19 years old. I am currently a software development student hoping to do an apprenticeship
                    on Cyber Security once this course ends.
                    <br></br>

                    In my free time, I create content on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram - I take interesting stories, fun-facts, jokes etc. and interesting QnA's that 
                    bring curiosity to the viewer and create it in the form of a video where people that come across my content watch! 
                    <br></br>

                    Exercising is also a huge part of my life - I go walking on average 40 minutes a day, lift weights x4 weekly and use the rowing machine x4 - x5 weekly 
                    each rowing session lasting 10 - 25 minutes.
                    <br></br>

                <h2> FUTURE GOALS</h2>
                <p>As for my future goals, I wish to go into cyber security - I have applied for a two year apprenticeship course for this and I hope to move to another country 
                     preferably in Europe after a 
                    few years to work in the cyber security field
                    </p>

                <br></br>

                <p> I will still be creating content on social media for as long as I can. I wish to use this to my advantage as a way to earn cash, to gain recognition
                    and hopefully work with brands for sponsorships </p>

                    <br></br>
                <p> I also will be creating t-shirts to sell for as long as I can. As of now, the t-shirts I will sell will be on Amazon however, I wish to expand to
                    other sites such as Etsy & Teespring
